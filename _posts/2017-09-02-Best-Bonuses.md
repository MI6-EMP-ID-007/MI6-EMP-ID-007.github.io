    The best Bonuses in the Online Casino world laid out for you
---

There are heaps of online Casinos out there and finding the one that is just right for you is no easy task. One of the first things new players are immediately confronted with when opening an online Casino website is that casinos opening offer.

This welcome Bonus is usually quite large and it allows players to gauge how much an online casino is willing to invest into it's potential customers right from the get go. I know that one should not judge a book by it's cover, but we are not judging books here. We are judging online Casinos and one of the hard truths of this business is that if they can't make you a good welcome offer then they probably do not have much else to offer you.

So it is very important to look for a casino that offers you a good deal. And I mean a good deal for you. The kind of welcome bonus that a casino offers it's players is indicative of the kind of player it is trying to attract. Not all casinos are the same and that is good because not all players play the same way.

Some players like to bet big, they dont mind blowing through their whole playing budget in a few sweet minutes, and that is okay for them. Others like to savour their playtime and make it last and that is okay too. So some casinos will offer their players one big welcome offer, while others rather offer 5 small ones. It all boils down to the kind of player they would like to attract.

Our long years of experience in the casino industry and our data driven approach to finding information have allowed us to identify three main Player types and therefore three main kinds of opening offers that can be found across the web.

The High Roller - He/She likes to bet big in the hopes of winning big after all you have to risk it to get the biscuit and life is meant to be lived to the fullest.
The Leisure Gamer - He/She likes to relax, take their time and enjoy their gambling experience. What's the point of life, if not to enjoy every moment and everybody deserves a bit of joy every now and then.
The Mathematician - He/She likes to maximise their winnings by betting smart and getting the most value for money out of their bets. Losing is for suckers.

So the below table will show three columns with the best opening offers for each of the respective player type.
