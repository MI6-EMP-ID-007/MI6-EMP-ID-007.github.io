Hello and welcome to Casinocademy!
<br/>
As this is the very first post on this page I feel that I should start with a short outline of the why, the how and the who of this Website. Fortunately, it&#39;s all quite simple and doesn&#39;t take all that long to explain.
<br>
**THE WHY:**

Despite the MASSIVE amount of Casino and Gambling Websites that can be found online, it turns out that almost all of them provide their readers with ZERO infos on how this online gambling stuff actually works. After a while many players just give up on finding out how to most of the stuff works and just gamble away. This however diminishes their fun and their potential for wins.

**THE HOW:**

And that&#39;s where we come in, we provide knowledge, tips, tricks, explanations, how to&#39;s, reviews, and more, all so that the players of the world have a better idea of the ins and outs of the online Casinos.

Casinocademy therefore allows aspiring, intermediate and expert Casinoplayers to inform themselves about important online casino topics. Armed with this valuable information they can then be sure to make the most of their money and time when gambling online.

**THE WHO**

Last but not least, who are we. We are a group of online casino players, industry professionals and experts that have made it their mission to finally put the power back in the hands of the players that provide online casinos with their income.

So that&#39;s all for now, look out for further great inspirational Blog posts. The very next one will already provide valuable information.
